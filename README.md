## Papers 
### General:
1. [Demystifying Parallel and Distributed Deep Learning: An In-Depth Concurrency Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09941):discusses the different types of concurrency in DNNs; synchronous and asynchronous stochastic gradient descent; distributed system architectures; communication schemes; and performance modeling. Based on these approaches, it also extrapolates the  potential directions for parallelism in deep learning. 
2. [A Hitchhiker’s Guide On Distributed Training of Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.11787.pdf)

## Model Consistency:
### Synchronization:
#### Synchronous techniques: 
1. [Deep learning with COTS HPC systems](http://ai.stanford.edu/~acoates/papers/CoatesHuvalWangWuNgCatanzaro_icml2013.pdf): Commodity Off-The-Shelf High Performance Computing (COTS HPC) technology, a cluster of GPU servers with Infiniband interconnects and MPI.
2. [FireCaffe: near-linear acceleration of deep neural network training on compute clusters
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00175): The speed and scalability of distributed
algorithms is almost always limited by the overhead of communicating between servers; DNN training is not an exception to
this rule. Therefore, the key consideration this paper makes is to reduce communication overhead wherever possible, while not degrading the accuracy of the DNN models that we train. 
3. [SparkNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06051): Training Deep Networks in Spark. In Proceedings of the
International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

Data-Parallel Distributed Training of Speech DNNs, In Interspeech 2014.
5. [Scalable Distributed DNN Training Using
Commodity GPU Cloud Computing](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/amazon.jobs-public-documents/strom_interspeech2015.pdf):It introduces a new method for scaling up distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) training of Deep Neural
Networks (DNN). The method solves the well-known communication bottleneck problem that arises for data-parallel SGD because compute nodes frequently need to synchronize a replica of the model.
